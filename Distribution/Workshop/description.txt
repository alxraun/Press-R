[b]ALPHA VERSION - USE WITH CAUTION[/b]

This mod is in an early alpha stage and has not been thoroughly tested. You may encounter performance issues or compatibility problems with other mods. Theoretically, this mod can be safely added to or removed from saves, and compatibility issues should primarily affect Press-R's stability. The author is not responsible for any problems that may arise from using this mod.

[center][img]URL_HEADER_FAQ[/img][/center]

[b]Q: Compatibility?[/b]
A: Should be compatible with most mods, including CE. However, comprehensive testing has not been performed yet. Please report any incompatibilities!

[b]Q: Performance?[/b]
A: Currently, you might experience unstable performance while Features are active (holding the Press-R Key), and also with a large number of items marked as "Held" by Direct Haul (~200+ items). When Features are inactive (Press-R Key is not held), performance impact depends mainly on the number of "Held" items. Future optimizations could potentially reduce the current performance impact by up to 90%.
