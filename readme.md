Welcome! I'm glad you're interested in contributing!

### Contribution Philosophy & Process

*   **Collaborative Learning & Growth:** I'm new to C# and RimWorld modding (started programming Nov 2024, modding Mar 2025), and this project is a learning journey for me. I deeply appreciate the opportunity to learn from the community and welcome anyone who wants to join in, share their experience, or offer advice.
*   **Careful Consideration of Contributions:** Every idea and line of code submitted will be carefully reviewed. I (with the help of AI assistants) will strive to understand your proposed solutions and determine how best to integrate them.
*   **Discussion & Finding the Best Solutions:** Your experience and perspective are highly valuable. I'm open to your approaches and happy to discuss them to understand the benefits and collaboratively find the optimal solution, especially if your experience points towards a better path.
*   **Evolving Processes:** As I'm still learning the ropes of Git, GitHub, and collaborative development, our workflows might evolve over time as we gain more experience. Suggestions for improving the workflow are also welcome!

### Role of AI in Development

This project actively utilizes AI tools as development assistant. AI helps in various aspects:
*   **Design and Architecture:** Assisting in developing architectural solutions, refactoring, and suggesting optimal approaches, including integrating contributions from various participants.
*   **Code Analysis and Improvement:** Analyzing existing and proposed code, identifying potential improvements, and developing ideas further.
*   **Tool, Not Replacement:** AI is used for support and code generation. Final design and implementation decisions are made by the author, considering contributor feedback.

## About the Author

I started programming in November 2024 and began developing this mod in March 2025. Press-R is my first C# project. I would be very grateful for constructive advice, code reviews, and any help from more experienced developers.
