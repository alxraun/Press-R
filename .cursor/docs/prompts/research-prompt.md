### `Research`

`Research` is a process where the `file_search` and `grep_search` tools are actively used to find and gather any information. When you are asked to conduct `research`, or if it is necessary, follow the instructions below.

`Research` Process:
- STEP 1. Use <potential_codebase_context> as a starting point for the `research`. <potential_codebase_context> alone is not sufficient to draw conclusions.
- STEP 2. Formulate a list of questions, hypotheses, assumptions, and a `research` plan.
- STEP 3. Start the `research`, actively using the `file_search` and `grep_search` tools to find and gather any relevant information.
- STEP 4. Having obtained intermediate results, formulate a new list of questions, hypotheses, assumptions, and a `research` plan.
- STEP 5. Continue the `research`, actively using the `file_search` and `grep_search` tools.
- STEP 6. When no more hypotheses, assumptions, or questions remain - complete the `research`.

Clarifications:
- In `research`, you must always use the `file_search` and `grep_search` tools.
- If after the `research`, words like "possibly", "probably" are used - this is a signal that the `research` is not finished, in such a situation, repeat the `research` process.
