### `Research`

`Research` is a process where the `file_search` and `grep_search` tools are actively used to find and gather any information. When you are asked to conduct `Research`, follow the `Research` Guidelines below.

`Research` Guidelines:
- STEP 0. Choose the relevant type of `Research`; you can use and combine multiple `Research` types depending on the situation.
- STEP 1. Use <potential_codebase_context> as a starting point for the `Research`. <potential_codebase_context> alone is not sufficient to draw conclusions.
- STEP 2. Formulate a list of questions, hypotheses, assumptions, and a `Research` plan.
- STEP 3. Start the `Research`, actively using the `file_search` and `grep_search` tools to find and gather any relevant information.
- STEP 4. Having obtained intermediate results, formulate a new list of questions, hypotheses, assumptions, and a `Research` plan.
- STEP 5. Continue the `Research`, actively using the `file_search` and `grep_search` tools.
- STEP 6. When no more hypotheses, assumptions, or questions remain - complete the `Research`.

Clarifications:
- In `Research`, you must always use the `file_search` and `grep_search` tools.
- If after the `Research`, words like "possibly", "probably" are used - this is a signal that the `Research` is not finished; in such a situation, repeat the `Research` process.
- If you find irrefutable evidence that the already gathered `Research` results are fully comprehensive, report that further `Research` is not required.

### Types of `Research`

All types of `Research` follow the general `Research` Guidelines but have a different focus. When requested to conduct `Research`, you can choose one of the types or a combination of them.

#### `Research` (Default)

*   **Goal:** Standard `Research`.
*   **Focus of `Research` Guidelines:** Follow the standard `Research` Guidelines.
*   **When Used:** As the default `Research` type.

#### `Follow-up Research`

*   **Goal:** Sequentially deepen and expand the research based on *previous* results.
*   **Focus of `Research` Guidelines:** Develop current hypotheses, answer questions that arose during the previous iteration.
*   **When Used:** As a standard `Research` iteration when the topic needs further study.

#### `Gap Analysis Research`

*   **Goal:** Find and identify *missing or unknown* information to ensure research completeness.
*   **Focus of `Research` Guidelines:** Search for information that might have been missed or whose existence was not suspected.
*   **When Used:** When there is suspicion that the existing `Research` results have gaps.

#### `Verification Research`

*   **Goal:** Check the accuracy and reliability of *previously gathered* information and conclusions.
*   **Focus of `Research` Guidelines:** Identify errors and inaccuracies in existing `Research` results.
*   **When Used:** When the accuracy and reliability of already gathered information need to be checked.
