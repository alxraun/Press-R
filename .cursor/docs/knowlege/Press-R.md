## `Press-R`

### Description

`Press-R` is a Quality-of-Life (QoL) mod designed to enhance user experience by simplifying complex and routine actions through various `Features`.

### `PressR_ModifierKey`

A single modifier key (default `R`) activates `Press-R` features based on the current game context.

### `Features`

`Press-R` is extensible, allowing new `Features` to be added.

#### `TabLens` Feature

Allows interactive toggling of `ITab` checkboxes by clicking `Thing`s on the map, visualizing their status with a `TabLensOverlay`. Activated by holding `PressR_ModifierKey` while a supported `ITab` is open.

#### `DirectHaul` Feature

Enables players to directly assign hauling tasks for specific items to a target location, preventing automatic re-hauling while keeping items available, mimicking stockpile behavior. Activated by holding `PressR_ModifierKey` while haulable items are selected.
