### Function Naming

**Semantic and Technical Accuracy**:
- Names must be **semantically and technically accurate**, clearly and unambiguously describing the function's logic, purpose, and technical implementation. Avoid ambiguity.

**Consistency**:
- Ensure **consistency** in naming for logically grouped functions.

**Avoid Generic Words in Naming**:
- Names should be specific and descriptive, minimizing ambiguity.
- Generic words such as `Process`, `Handle`, `Manage`, `Context`, `Data`, `Info`, `Item`, `Value`, `Thing`, `Object`, `Result`, `Flag`, `State` can obscure meaning and purpose.
- Strive for names that accurately reflect the function's role, content, or action within its specific domain.

**Boolean Functions**:
- For functions returning `bool`, use the prefixes `is` or `has`.

**Examples of Good Names**:
- `GetThingsInCellOfType`
- `GetSelectedHaulableThings`
- `IsThingInViewRect`
- `AllowThingDefsInFilter`
