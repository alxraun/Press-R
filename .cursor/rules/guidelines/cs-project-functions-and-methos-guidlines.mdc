1. **`Single Responsibility Principle`**

- Methods and functions should do one thing, do it well and do only that
- Break down methods/functions that perform multiple tasks.
- Favor small, single-purpose private methods.
- Avoid side effects in methods and functions.
- Functions and methods should only be one level of abstraction

2. **Avoid side effects in methods and functions**

- Functions should take input and return output, not change external state.
- Centralize necessary side effects in specific services.

3. **Functions and methods should only be one level of abstraction**

- Mixing high-level logic (e.g., parsing workflow) with low-level details (e.g., regex specifics) in one function makes it complex. Extract details into helper functions or classes.

4. **In methods and functions, there should be no more than two levels of indentation**

5. **Function arguments (2 or fewer ideally)**

- Fewer arguments make functions easier to understand.
- Consolidate multiple arguments into a parameter object/class.
