### General

1. **Use recognizable terms and domain names**

- Important to use standard, established and understandable terms that correspond to `POLS`.

2. **Avoid mental mapping**

### Functions and Methods

1. **Semantic and Technical Accuracy**

- Names must be semantically and technically accurate, clearly and unambiguously describing what the function should do, what it returns, and what it does. Avoid ambiguity.

- Good: `GetVisibleThingsInViewRectOfType`, `GetThingsInCellOfType`, `GetSelectedHaulableThings`, `IsThingInViewRect`, `AllowThingDefsInFilter`

2. **Logically and semantically related functions or methods should have consistent names**

- Bad: `KillTween`, `RemoveAllTweens`, `DeleteAllTweensForTarget`.
- Good: `KillTween`, `KillAllTweens`, `KillAllTweensForTarget`.

3. **For functions returning `bool`, use the prefixes `is` or `has`**

### Variables

1. **Logically and semantically related variables should have consistent names**

- Bad: `desiredKeys`, `keysToRemove`.
- Good: `keysToAdd`, `keysToRemove`.

2. **Name the variable to reflect what it is used for**
